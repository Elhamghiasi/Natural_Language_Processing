# Introduction

The **Twitter US Airline Sentiment Dataset** is a collection of tweets where people shared their thoughts about major U.S. airlines like United, American, Southwest, and Delta. With over **14,000 tweets**, each one is labeled as having a **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative** sentiment. This dataset provides insight into how customers feel about their airline experiences, especially when it comes to service. It’s often used in **sentiment analysis projects** and is a great resource for applying **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** in a real-world setting.

In this project, I’m working with the **Twitter US Airline Sentiment Dataset** to perform **sentiment analysis** using NLP techniques. I’ll start with some **exploratory data analysis** to get familiar with the data, then move on to **cleaning and preprocessing** the text.
