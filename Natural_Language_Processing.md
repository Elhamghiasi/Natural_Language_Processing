#  Natural Language Processing: Twitter US Airline Sentiment Analysis

##  Dataset
**Twitter US Airline Sentiment Dataset**

---

## Part 1: EDA & Feature Engineering

###  a. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Load the dataset and inspect dimensions.
- Handle any null values.
- Analyze tweet/post length distributions.
- Examine sentiment label proportions.

###  b. Text Visualization
- Generate word clouds for each sentiment class.
- Identify and visualize top **n** most frequent words.
- Plot histograms of tweet/post lengths.

###  c. Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- Preprocessing steps:
  - Lowercasing
  - Punctuation removal
  - Stopword removal
  - Stemming or lemmatization
- Feature representations:
  - Bag of Words (BoW)
  - TF-IDF

## Part 2: Model Building

###  a. Model Training
Train and evaluate four models:
- **Explainable models:**
  - Logistic Regression
  - Naive Bayes or Decision Tree
- **Black-box models:**
  - LSTM
  - RNN or BERT

Evaluation:
- Use the same feature set across models.
- Apply train/test split or cross-validation.
- Report:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score
  - Confusion matrix

###  b. Architecture & Implementation Details
- Describe full pipeline:  
  `Text Vectorization → Model → Evaluation`
- Specify vectorization methods (e.g., TF-IDF, embeddings).
- Model specifications:
  - Logistic Regression with L2 regularization
  - LSTM with 128 units and dropout layers
- For neural models:
  - Architecture: layers, activations, dropout
  - Training details: optimizer, batch size, epochs

###  c. Initial Observations
- Compare model performance.
- Discuss significant differences between models.
- Identify strengths/weaknesses of simple vs black-box models.

## Part 3: Interpretation, Error Analysis & Trade-Offs

###  a. Error Analysis
- Analyze 10–15 misclassified samples.
- Discuss ambiguities, sarcasm, tweet length, and class confusion.

###  b. Class Sensitivity & Confusion Patterns
- Compute per-class precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualize confusion matrices for each model.
- Discuss impact of:
  - Class imbalance
  - Tweet structure

###  c. Explainability vs Performance
- Compare explainable vs black-box models.
- Is performance gain worth the loss of interpretability?
